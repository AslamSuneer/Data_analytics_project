Basic Idea of the Detection Folder:

1.Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb:
This Jupyter notebook likely implements a machine learning model for detecting spam emails. It may use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text data from emails, converting them into numerical features for classification using models like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

2.spam.csv:
This dataset likely contains labeled email data with features such as email content and a label marking each email as either spam or not spam. This data is probably used for training and testing the spam detection model.

3.model.pkl:
This file contains a trained machine learning model that was serialized (pickled) using Python. The model can be loaded and used to predict whether new emails are spam or not.

4.vectorizer.pkl:
The vectorizer is likely responsible for converting the email text into a numerical format, such as a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix. This is essential for feeding the email content into the machine learning model.

5.checking.txt:
A simple text file that may contain test notes or intermediary information related to the spam detection project.

6.ipynb_checkpoints:
These are automatically generated checkpoints created by Jupyter Notebook during work sessions, used for autosaving progress.
